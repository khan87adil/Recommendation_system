    "Well, I love ted talks, who doesn't? When I first looked at this dataset, a couple of things struck, me, first, the fact that, since this dataset contains transcripts of many ted talks, by default we have a corpus which is very rich and linguistically very well structured. Second, since this corpus has nice linguistic properties, this is probably as good a dataset as Reuters 20 News Group or any version of Guttenberg corpus. This got me thinking:\n",

So the vector  (1,1,1,1,0,0) , represents the count of words \"This\",\"is\",\"sentence\",\"one\",\"two\",\"three\" in document 1.This is known as a count matrix. There is one issue with such a representation of text though, it doesn't take into account the importance of words in a document. For example, the word \"one\" occurs only once in the document 1 but is missing in the other documents, so from the point of view of its importance, \"one\" is an important word for document 1 as it characterises it, but if we look at the count vector for document 1, we can see that \"one\" gets of weight of 1 so do words like \"This\", \"is\" etc. Issues, regarding the importance of words in a document can be handled using what is known as Tf-Idf.\n",

Term Frequency measures how often the word appears in a given document, while Inverse document frequency measures how rare the word is in a corpus. The product of these two quantities, measures the importance of the word and is known as Tf-Idf. Creating a tf-idf representation is fairly straightforward, if you are working with a machine learning frame-work, such as scikit-learn, it's fairly straighforward to create a matrix representation of text data"
